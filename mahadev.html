<h1>Har Har Mahadev</h1>
<p>I think many people do not know the real Har Har Mahadev meaning. Mahadev means the god of the gods. It is one of the most popular names of Lord Shiva. Therefore, there is no issue with the meaning of the word Mahadev. The word Har has more than one meaning.</p>
<p>1. Har is one of the<a href="https://www.hinduismfacts.org/names-of-lord-shiva/" name="names of the shiva" target="_blank"> names of Lord Shiva.</a>  Therefore, Har Har Mahadev simply means “Shiva Shiva Shiva.”</p> 
<p>2. One of the meanings of Har (original Hara) is “to take away.” It also means destroyer. The devotees plead to Lord Shiva to take away or destroy their miseries, ego, ignorance, etc. Therefore, they say Har Har Mahadev, which means “Please take away (destroy) bad things in our life, O Lord Shiva.”</p>
<p>3. In Hindi, Har means everyone. Therefore, Har Har Mahadev means “Everyone is Lord Shiva.”</p>

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
<br>
<p>
The first meaning does not make any sense.
</p>
<p><h3>Har Har Mahadev is an ancient chant and the word has its roots in Sanskrit. Therefore, the Hindi meaning of the word is not useful here. Therefore, the third meaning is also not valid.</h3>
</p>
<p><h3>Among all the three meanings mentioned above, the second meaning sounds quite logical as devotees request the lord to take away their pain and ignorance.</h3>
</p>
<p><b>Therefore, we can conclude that Har Har Mahadev means “Please take away (destroy) my sorrow and ignorance, O Lord Shiva.”
